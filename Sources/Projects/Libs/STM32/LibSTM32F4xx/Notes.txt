HAL Lib from STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.1.0
  Download and install seperatly to update sources.
  Needed sources to build are in repositiory.

RefreshFiles.bat to get source files from ST download package
  Needs path to top folder of downloaded package.
  E.g. C:\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.1.0.

stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h modified
  In Includes subfolder and doesn't get refreshed with RefreshFiles.bat

Build without ETH module - not anymore
  stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h defines macros for ETH which user might want to change.
  
User needs to provide few functions
  LibSTM32F4xx_GetHSEValue() and LibSTM32F4xx_GetExternalClockValue()
  must be implemented in user's application.
  E.g.
  uint32_t LibSTM32F4xx_GetHSEValue() { return HSE_VALUE; }
  uint32_t LibSTM32F4xx_GetExternalClockValue() { return EXTERNAL_CLOCK_VALUE; }
  
system_stm32f4xx.c included

Startup assembler code
  Pre build step must be configured for each configuration to generate startup.asm
  with proper startup_stm32f4xxxx.s .include statment. MakeStartupFile.bat is
  provided to echo argument line derivate specific file in it.
